## About the project
this project was implemented as part of the Python basics course. I wanted to learn web scraping and i am also huge fan of NHL and data nerd so i chose this subject and also studied the basics of Beautifulsoup and Pandas. I am also interested to learn analyzing and working with data so this is great way to gather some data for that.
